    "This notebook focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Developer Survey Dataset. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it helps us understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. By analyzing this dataset, we can uncover patterns, relationships, and potential insights that can guide further analysis and decision-making.\n",

    "The relationship between education level and employment status.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common programming roles (DevType).\n",
